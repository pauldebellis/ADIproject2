#MOBILE MOD DB

This is an Android application intended to help users keep a personal database of mods they like, use, or just want to keep in mind for a later date.

There are a couple websites that host nearly all noteworthy Skyrim mods, and there are even applications that help organize and install mods, but with MMDB I hope to give modders a way to keep track of interesting mods on-the-go, when they can't necessarily download them. By keeping the database on your phone, you can tell friends about mods, remind yourself of details, and track mods to download when you return to your computer.

*As a modder, I want to search my database for a particular mod.*

MMDB has a search function in the top right. When pressed, it will open a dialog box that allows the user to enter a search string, then choose which parameters to use for the search. Users can search by name, description, or number of endorsements. 

*As a modder, I want to browse mods by genre.*

The home screen of MMDB is a clickable list of the major categories of mods. When clicked, the user will be directed to a screen with a list of all mods filed under that category, each of which can in turn be clicked to view details of a particular mod.

*As a modder, I want to sort mods by endorsements*

By default the mods in each category will be listed alphabetically to ease browsing. By clicking the "thumbs up" icon, the mods can be resorted by endorsements, showing mods in descending order of popularity.

*As a modder, I want to add mods to the database*

As the intent of this app is for each user to curate their own personal library of mods, the database will be empty when the app is first launched. By clicking a floating action button, a user can begin population their library by entering the mod's name, category, number of endorsements, as well as a link to download the mod.
