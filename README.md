#MOBILE MOD DB

This is an Android application intended to help users keep a personal database of mods they like, use, or just want to keep in mind for a later date.

There are a couple websites that host nearly all noteworthy Skyrim mods, and there are even applications that help organize and install mods, but with MMDB I hope to give modders a way to keep track of interesting mods on-the-go, when they can't necessarily download them. By keeping the database on your phone, you can tell friends about mods, remind yourself of details, and track mods to download when you return to your computer.

##USER STORIES

*As a modder, I want to add mods to the database*

As the intent of this app is for each user to curate their own personal library of mods, the database will be empty when the app is first launched. By clicking a button, a user can begin population their library by entering the mod's name, category, and number of endorsements.

*As a modder, I want to see the popularity of each mod at a glance.*

The home screen of MMDB is a list of all mods in the database, with each mod's name and number of Nexus endorsements. Each can be clicked to view all details about the mod.

*As a modder, I want to search my database for a particular mod.*

MMDB has a search function in the top right. When pressed, it will open a dialog box that allows the user to enter a search string. Users can search by name, description, or number of endorsements. 


*As a modder, I want to search for mods above a given number of endorsements*

If a user enters a number into the search string, only mods whose endorsements are above that number will be displayed in the results.
